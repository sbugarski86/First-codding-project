# First-coding-project

## Stevan Bugarski

In this project I'm going to build a portfolio site for an artist. The site is going to content a several pages, linked together.

It is going to be possible to go back to the home page from any pages of the site.

You'll be able to see the artists resume, contact information, buy art work online or order art work (like portraits...).

For this project I'm going to use HTML5, CSS3 and some JavaScript.

In the future my plan is to improve this web site using Bootstrap, responsive web design, JavaScript libraries, basically to write less code and build the sites faster.
