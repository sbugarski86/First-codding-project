              <p class="art-p">My work uses imagery of processed food in its disposable packaging to explore the dichotomy of what is right versus what is easy and the unfairness yet naturalness of all good times coming to an eventual end.
    
                  My interest in and struggles with healthy eating habits have helped fuel this exploration. Food is a useful conduit for addressing the futility in the cycle of advertisement and consumption in America today: pretty logos and packaging seduce consumers, only to be tossed aside once the object of desire is eaten, while misleading advertisements generate a crowd of exploited consumers. Many of the items marketed for human consumption are humorous and absurd and I attempt to show this through my paintings. I strive to be honest and frank, while staying light-hearted and playful.
                  
                  I use bold hues, flat planes of color, word play, and text to make my paintings reminiscent of appealing product design. I often leave specific negative spaces surrounding or within the objects to signify the emptiness of what we are consuming and the significance of unfulfilled expectations. Additionally, I find that the use of exposed raw canvas, contour lines, glitter or other mixed media, and a painterly, opaque way of applying paint to the canvas helps me further investigate the connections between a child-like faith in what we are told is acceptable and the (subconscious) cyclical desire to fill up emotional or spiritual voids with a physical substance (i.e. food.)
                  
                  Many of my images contain products spilling, oozing, or exploding out of their packaging to illustrate the hidden truth bursting free. I try to incorporate yellow into every work of art, as it is my favorite color, thus representing my role in this phenomenon, not just as an outside observer, but as a victim and as a reluctant yet willful participant.</p>
